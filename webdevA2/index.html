            <h2>What Are Whales</h2>
            <h3>Physical features</h3>
            <p>
                Whales are generally more than 3 metres long. Several species, mainly baleens, may be 18 metres long or
                more. (The blue whale is the largest animal that has ever lived. It may be more than 30 metres long.)
                Whales usually come in colours like black, gray, black and white, or white. Some types are bluish gray.
                Beneath its smooth skin, a thick layer of fat called blubber, protects the animal from cold water.
                The torpedo-shaped body of the whale helps it to move quickly through the water. It has a tail that is
                divided into two broad sections called flukes, which extend horizontally (side to side) instead of
                vertically
                (up and down), as the fins of a fish do. A whale also uses two flippers on the front of its body for
                steering. Whales go to the surface of the water to breathe through one or two openings, called
                blowholes, on the
                top of the head.

            <h3>Feeding methods</h3>
            <p>
                Whales are categorised into 2 groups - toothed whales and baleen whales. Toothed whales such as sperm
                whales and beluga whales, use their teeth to hunt and eat their prey. Meanwhile, baleen whales use
                baleen, a bristle-like structure made of keratin protein ( same material as our hair and fingernails )
                that hangs down from its top jaw, to filter and strain large quantities of water while capturing
                smaller prey like schooling fish or krill in their mouth. Examples of such whales are the sperm whales
                and grey whales.

            <h2>Brief History of Whales</h2>
            <h3>What Whales Looked Like Before</h3>
            <p>
                Although whales are expert swimmers and perfectly adapted to life underwater, these marine mammals
                actually used to walked on four legs. Their land-dwelling ancestors lived about 50 million years ago.

            <p>
                Many of the fossils of their ancestors are found at Wadi Al-Hitan, Whale Valley, in the Western Desert
                of Egypt. The remains display the typical streamlined body form of modern whales, yet retain some of the
                primitive aspects of skull and tooth structure. The largest skeleton found reached up to 21 m in length,
                with well-developed five-fingered flippers on the forelimbs and the unexpected presence of hind legs,
                feet, and toes, not known previously in any archaeoceti (a now extinct sub-order of whales). Their form
                was serpentine and they were carnivorous. A few of these skeletal remains are exposed but most are
                shallowly buried in sediments, slowly uncovered by erosion. Wadi Al-Hitan provides evidence of millions
                of years of coastal marine life.

            <h2>Whale Endangerment</h2>
            <h3>Statistics</h3>
            <p>
                According to the official World Wildlife Fund (WWF) website, 6 out of the 13 great whale species are
                classified as endangered or vulnerable, even after decades of protection. An estimated minimum of
                300,000 whales and dolphins are killed each year as a result of fisheries bycatch, while others succumb
                to a myriad of threats including shipping and habitat loss.
            </p>
            <h3>Impacts of Whaling</h3>

            <p>
                From the early 17th century until as recently as 1986, humans hunted whales for their oil, meat, and
                body
                parts. The International Whaling Commission (IWC), the organization responsible for regulating whaling,
                placed a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986 (the US outlawed whaling in 1971). While whaling is
                illegal in most countries, Norway, Japan, and Iceland continue to engage in the practice. During the
                global whaling period, scientists estimate that whale populations declined by 66 to 90 percent from
                pre-whaling numbers.
